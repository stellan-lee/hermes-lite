# Env var names that influence how the next subprocess executes —

# the loader, interpreter, shell, or replacement editor counts:
#
# * ``LD_PRELOAD`` / ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` / ``LD_AUDIT`` — Linux dynamic
#   loader. ``DYLD_*`` — macOS equivalent. Planting a path here means
#   the next ``subprocess.run([...])`` Marlow makes loads attacker code
#   before main().
# * ``PYTHONPATH`` / ``PYTHONHOME`` / ``PYTHONSTARTUP`` /
#   ``PYTHONUSERBASE`` — Python interpreter init. Marlow itself starts
#   from one of these on every restart.
# * ``NODE_OPTIONS`` / ``NODE_PATH`` — Node interpreter; affects npm,
#   ``marlow update``, the TUI build.
# * ``PATH`` — too broad to allow. Configuration writers never need to
#   rewrite the operator's PATH; if a tool can't be found, add an
#   absolute path in the integration config, not to mutate PATH globally.
# * ``GIT_SSH_COMMAND`` / ``GIT_EXEC_PATH`` — git rewrites that fire
#   on every plugin install / ``marlow update``.
# * ``BROWSER`` / ``EDITOR`` / ``VISUAL`` / ``PAGER`` — commands the
#   shell or CLI invokes implicitly. Wrong values here = RCE on next
#   ``$EDITOR``.
# * ``SHELL`` — what subprocess uses with ``shell=True`` (we try to
#   avoid that, but defense in depth).
# * ``MARLOW_HOME`` / ``MARLOW_PROFILE`` / ``MARLOW_CONFIG`` /
#   ``MARLOW_ENV`` — Marlow runtime location flags. Writing these into
#   ``.env`` would relocate state in ways the user did not request from
#   an env writer. ``config.yaml`` is the supported surface for these.
#
# IMPORTANT: ``MARLOW_*`` overall is NOT blocked. Many legitimate
# integration credentials follow that prefix (for example,
# MARLOW_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY). The
# denylist is name-by-name on purpose so the gate stays narrow and
# doesn't accidentally break provider setup wizards.

✗ ``marlow update`` doesn't apply inside the Docker container.

Marlow Agent runs as a published image (nousresearch/marlow-agent), not a
git checkout — the container has no working tree to pull into.  Update by
pulling a fresh image and restarting your container instead:

  docker pull nousresearch/marlow-agent:latest
  # then restart whatever started the container, e.g.:
  docker compose up -d --force-recreate marlow-agent
  # or, for ad-hoc runs, exit the current container and `docker run` again

Verify the new version after restart:
  docker run --rm nousresearch/marlow-agent:latest --version

Notes:
  • If you pinned a specific tag (e.g. ``:v0.14.0``) the ``:latest`` tag
    won't move your container — pull the newer tag you actually want, or
    switch to ``:latest`` / ``:main`` for rolling updates.  See available
    tags at https://hub.docker.com/r/nousresearch/marlow-agent/tags
  • Your config and session history live under ``$MARLOW_HOME`` (``/opt/data``
    in the container, typically bind-mounted from the host) and persist
    across image upgrades — re-pulling doesn't lose any state.
  • Running a fork?  Build your own image with this repo's ``Dockerfile``

      1. Missing intermediate keys (returns ``default``, no KeyError).
