#!/command/with-contenv sh
# shellcheck shell=sh
# /opt/marlow/docker/main-wrapper.sh — wraps the container's CMD with
# the same argument-routing logic the pre-s6 entrypoint.sh used. Runs
# as /init's "main program" (Docker CMD) so it inherits stdin/stdout/
# stderr from the container.
#
# Shebang note: /init scrubs env before invoking CMD, so a plain
# `#!/bin/sh` wrapper sees an empty environ and `ENV MARLOW_HOME=/opt/data`
# from the Dockerfile never reaches `marlow`. with-contenv repopulates
# the env from /run/s6/container_environment before exec'ing, which is
# what s6-supervised services use too (see main-marlow/run).
#
# Routing:
#   no args                       → exec `marlow` (the default)
#   first arg is an executable    → exec it directly (sleep, bash, sh, …)
#   first arg is anything else    → exec `marlow <args>` (subcommand passthrough)
#
# Drop to marlow via s6-setuidgid, but skip it when already non-root.

# HOME comes through with-contenv as /root (the /init context). Override
# to the marlow user's home before dropping privileges so libraries that
# resolve paths via $HOME (e.g. discord lockfile under XDG_STATE_HOME)
# don't try to write to /root.
